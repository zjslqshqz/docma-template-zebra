This project is a fork of https://github.com/onury/docma  and is mainly focused on solving dependency issues.

It supports  `nodejs >= 16`  .

Compared to the original project, this one has faster execution speeds, almost comparable to that of a rocket.

We would like to extend a special thanks to the new neo-jsdoc-x library at https://github.com/neomjs/jsdoc-x.
